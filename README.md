# RHook Doc
The React Hooks Documentation App is a web application that provides documentation for various React hooks, along with live code examples that can be edited and previewed in a sandbox environment. The app includes hooks related to performance optimization, state management, side effects, and utilities. Each hook documentation page includes a description of the hook, its parameters, and an example code snippet with editable source code and a live preview.

The app is built with React and uses the Babel API to provide a live code editor and preview environment. Users can edit the example code snippets and see the results immediately in the preview window, without having to set up a local development environment. The app also includes navigation and search functionality to help users easily find the hook they are looking for.

This project uses the following React hooks:

## Hooks in this docs
### Performance Hooks
- useCallback: This hook memoizes a callback function, so that it only re-renders when one of its dependencies change.
- useDeferredValue: This hook allows for deferred state updates, which can be useful for optimizing performance of certain UI components.
- useMemo: This hook memoizes the result of an expensive computation, so that it only recomputes when one of its dependencies change.
- useTransition: This hook allows for smooth transitions between UI states, which can be useful for improving the user experience.
### State Hooks
- useState: This hook provides state management within a functional component.
- useReducer: This hook provides a way to manage more complex state within a functional component, by dispatching actions to update the state.
- useContext: This hook allows for sharing state between components, without having to pass props down through intermediate components.
### Side Effect Hooks
- useEffect: This hook allows for side effects, such as fetching data from an API or updating the DOM, to be performed within a functional component.
- useLayoutEffect: This hook allows for side effects that require synchronous layout changes, such as measuring the size of a DOM element, to be performed within a functional component.
- useInsertionEffect: This hook allows for side effects that require DOM nodes to be inserted or removed, such as animations, to be performed within a functional component.
### Utilities Hooks
- useSyncExternalStore: This hook allows for synchronizing state between a local component and an external store, such as local storage or a server.
- useRef: This hook provides a way to store mutable values across re-renders of a component.
- useImperativeHandle: This hook allows for exposing a component's internal functions or state to its parent component.
- useDebugValue: This hook allows for displaying custom debugging information in the React DevTools.
- useId: This hook generates a unique ID that can be used for labeling and referencing elements in the DOM.

We thank the React team for developing these useful hooks, and for their ongoing contributions to the React ecosystem.

## Notable Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies:

- react and react-dom: These are the core libraries for building user interfaces in React.
- vite: This is a build tool that provides a fast development experience with hot module replacement and optimized production builds.
- @babel/preset-env: This is a Babel preset that enables the use of modern JavaScript features by transpiling them to older versions that are supported by the majority of browsers.
- @babel/preset-react: This is a Babel preset that provides support for JSX syntax in React.
- @babel/standalone: This is a standalone version of the Babel compiler that can be used to transpile code in the browser.
- acorn: This is a JavaScript parser that is used by Babel and other tools to parse JavaScript code.
- escodegen: This is a JavaScript code generator that is used by Babel and other tools to generate JavaScript code.
- react-simple-code-editor: This is a React component that provides a simple code editor with syntax highlighting and other features.
- prismjs: This is a lightweight syntax highlighting library that is used by react-simple-code-editor to highlight code.
- purecss: This is a minimalist CSS framework that provides a set of responsive and customizable styles for HTML elements.

We thank the developers of these open-source projects for their valuable contributions.
