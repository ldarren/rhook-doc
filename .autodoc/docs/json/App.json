  "summary": "This code defines the styles for a side menu and main content area in a web application. The SideMenu component is fixed to the left side of the screen and has a width of 250 pixels. It contains links that are styled as buttons with a background color that changes on hover. Disabled links have a gray background color. The main content area, represented by the App class, is displayed to the right of the SideMenu and has a margin of 250 pixels on the left side. The content is displayed using flexbox and has a font size of 18 pixels and a line height of 1.5. \n\nThe code also defines styles for panels that are used to display information about different modules in the application. There are four types of modules: state, side effect, performance, and utility. Each type of module has a different border color and is labeled with a text label that is displayed to the left of the panel. The label is generated using the :after pseudo-element and the content property. The layout-item-module class is used to style the label text. \n\nThe code includes a media query that makes the SideMenu responsive when the screen width is less than 768 pixels. The SideMenu takes up the full width of the screen and the App content area has no margin on the left side. \n\nThis code is part of the rhook-doc project and can be used to style the user interface of the documentation website. The SideMenu can be used to display a table of contents or navigation links to different sections of the documentation. The panels can be used to display information about different modules in the application, such as their purpose, inputs, and outputs. The styles defined in this code can be customized to match the branding and design of the application. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"SideMenu\">\n  <a href=\"#\">Introduction</a>\n  <a href=\"#\">Getting Started</a>\n  <a href=\"#\">API Reference</a>\n  <a href=\"#\" disabled>Advanced Topics</a>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"App\">\n  <div class=\"panel left-panel layout-item-module-state\">\n    <h2>State Module</h2>\n    <p>This module manages the state of the application.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"panel right-panel layout-item-module-effect\">\n    <h2>Side Effect Module</h2>\n    <p>This module handles side effects such as API calls and database queries.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```",
