The SideMenu component is fixed to the left side of the screen and has a width of 250 pixels. It contains links that are styled as buttons with a background color that changes on hover. Disabled links have a gray background color. The main content area, represented by the App class, is displayed to the right of the SideMenu and has a margin of 250 pixels on the left side. The content is displayed using flexbox and has a font size of 18 pixels and a line height of 1.5. \n\nThe code also defines styles for panels that are used to display information about different modules in the application. There are four types of modules: state, side effect, performance, and utility. Each type of module has a different border color and is labeled with a text label that is displayed to the left of the panel. The label is generated using the :after pseudo-element and the content property. The layout-item-module class is used to style the label text. \n\nThe code includes a media query that makes the SideMenu responsive when the screen width is less than 768 pixels. The SideMenu takes up the full width of the screen and the App content area has no margin on the left side. \n\nThis code is part of the rhook-doc project and can be used to style the user interface of the documentation website. The SideMenu can be used to display a table of contents or navigation links to different sections of the documentation. The panels can be used to display information about different modules in the application, such as their purpose, inputs, and outputs. The styles defined in this code can be customized to match the branding and design of the application. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"SideMenu\">\n  <a href=\"#\">Introduction</a>\n  <a href=\"#\">Getting Started</a>\n  <a href=\"#\">API Reference</a>\n  <a href=\"#\" disabled>Advanced Topics</a>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"App\">\n  <div class=\"panel left-panel layout-item-module-state\">\n    <h2>State Module</h2>\n    <p>This module manages the state of the application.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"panel right-panel layout-item-module-effect\">\n    <h2>Side Effect Module</h2>\n    <p>This module handles side effects such as API calls and database queries.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `SideMenu` component and how is it styled?\n    \n    The `SideMenu` component is a fixed position menu with a width of 250px and a background color of #f7f7f7. It contains links styled as blocks with padding, margin, and border radius. When hovered over, the links change background color to #ddd.\n\n2. How is the layout of the `App` component structured and what is its default font size?\n    \n    The `App` component is displayed as a flex container with space between its items. It has a margin-left of 250px and padding of 20px. Its default font size is 18px with a line height of 1.5.\n\n3. What are the `layout-item-module` classes and how are they styled?\n    \n    The `layout-item-module` classes are used to style elements with a font size of 12px, color of #4b4b4b, and inline-block display. They have a padding of 0 .5714em and a margin-left of 1em. Each class also has a different border-left color and content after the element, which is capitalized and describes the type of module.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/App.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ldarren/rhook-doc/Routing.jsx)\n\nThe code defines a Router component that is used to set and identify pages in a React application.

The `RoutingContext` is a context object that is used to share the current page information between components. \n\nThe `Router` component reads the URL path and sets the default page to Home if not specified otherwise in the URL. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the current page state and the `useMemo` hook to memoize the context value object. The context value object contains the current page and a function to set the current page. \n\nThe `Router` component renders the `SideMenu` component and the `children` components wrapped in the `RoutingContext.Provider`.

It imports the RoutingContext and routes from another file called Routing. The RoutingContext is used to access the current page and setPage function from the context. The routes object contains key-value pairs where the key is the name of the page and the value is the URL path for that page.\n\nThe SideMenu component returns a div element with a class name of \"SideMenu\". Inside the div, it maps over the keys of the routes object using the Object.keys() method. For each key, it creates an anchor element with an href attribute that points to the corresponding URL path in the routes object. It also sets the key attribute to the current key and adds an onClick event listener that calls the setPage function with the corresponding URL path when the link is clicked. Finally, it disables the link if the current page matches the URL path.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to provide a navigation menu for the user to easily switch between different pages. It is flexible enough to handle any number of pages and can be easily updated by adding or removing pages from the routes object. Here is an example of how the SideMenu component can be used in another component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport SideMenu from './SideMenu'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <SideMenu />\n      <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>\n      {/* other components */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\nIn this example, the SideMenu component is rendered inside the App component and is used to display links to different pages in the application. The h1 element is just a placeholder for the content of the current page.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `RoutingContext` and `routes` variables imported from `./Routing`?\n- The `RoutingContext` is likely a context object used for managing routing information in the application, while `routes` is likely an object that maps route names to their corresponding URLs.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `disabled` prop in the `a` element?\n- The `disabled` prop is likely used to prevent the user from clicking on a link that corresponds to the current page, as indicated by the `page` state variable.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `setPage` function and how is it used?\n- The `setPage` function is likely used to update the `page` state variable in the `RoutingContext` object, which in turn triggers a re-render of the component tree.

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use the `useState` and `useCallback` hooks in React to manage state and optimize performance.\n\nThe `ParentComponent` component initializes two state variables, `profit` and `cost`, using the `useState` hook. It also defines two callback functions, `incrementProfit` and `incrementCost`, using the `useCallback` hook. These callback functions update the `profit` and `cost` state variables, respectively, by incrementing their values by 1.\n\nThe `ChildComponent` and `AnotherChildComponent` components are defined using the `React.memo` function, which is a higher-order component that memoizes the component to optimize performance. These components take a single prop, `increment`, which is a reference to the `incrementProfit` and `incrementCost` callback functions, respectively. When the user clicks the button in either child component, the corresponding callback function is called, which updates the state variable and causes the `ParentComponent` to re-render.\n\nOverall, this code demonstrates how to use the `useState` and `useCallback` hooks in React to manage state and optimize performance. By memoizing the child components using `React.memo`, the performance of the application is improved by reducing unnecessary re-renders.

This context object is then used to provide a theme value to two components: `ClassContextComponent` and `FunctionContextComponent`.\n\nThe `ClassContextComponent` is a class-based component that uses the `ThemeContext.Consumer` component to consume the theme value from the `ThemeContext` object. The `FunctionContextComponent` is a functional component that uses the `useContext` hook to consume the theme value from the `ThemeContext` object.\n\nThe `App` component is the main component that renders the `ClassContextComponent` and `FunctionContextComponent` components. It also provides the `darkTheme` value to the `ThemeContext` object using the `ThemeContext.Provider` component. The `toggleTheme` function is used to toggle the `darkTheme` value between `true` and `false` when the `Toggle Theme` button is clicked.\n\nThe `themeStyles` function is used to define the styles for the components based on the `darkTheme` value. If `darkTheme` is `true`, the background color and text color are set to `#333` and `#ccc` respectively. If `darkTheme` is `false`, the background color and text color are set to `#ccc` and `#333` respectively.\n\nThis code can be used as a starting point for managing the theme of a web application in React.

What is the purpose of the `ThemeContext` and `themeStyles` variables?\n    \n    `ThemeContext` is a React context used to pass down the current theme (dark or light) to child components. `themeStyles` is a function that returns an object with CSS styles based on the current theme.\n\n2. What is the difference between `ClassContextComponent` and `FunctionContextComponent`?\n    \n    `ClassContextComponent` is a class component that consumes the `ThemeContext` using the `Consumer` component. `FunctionContextComponent` is a function component that uses the `useContext` hook to consume the `ThemeContext`.\n\n3. How does the `toggleTheme` function work?\n    \n    `toggleTheme` is a function that toggles the `darkTheme` state between `true` and `false` using the `setDarkTheme` function from the `useState` hook.

The `useScrollY` function takes an optional `selector` argument that can be used to transform the scroll position before returning it. The `useDebugValue` hook is also used to display a debug label in React DevTools.\n\nThe `useSyncExternalStore` hook is a custom hook that allows React components to subscribe to external data sources and update their state accordingly. It takes three arguments: a `subscribe` function that returns a cleanup function, a `read` function that returns the current value of the external data source, and an `isEqual` function that determines whether the current value has changed since the last update. When the external data source changes, the `useSyncExternalStore` hook updates the state of the component and triggers a re-render.\n\nThe `subscribe` function in this code adds an event listener to the `scroll` event of the window and returns a cleanup function that removes the event listener. The `read` function returns the current vertical scroll position of the window, optionally transformed by the `selector` function. The `isEqual` function always returns `true`, indicating that the scroll position has changed whenever the `scroll` event is fired.\n\nThe `useScrollY` function is used to create a custom hook that can be used in other React components to get the current vertical scroll position of the window.

The `name` variable is initialized with an empty string. The `useDeferredValue` hook is used to create a new state variable called `deferredName`, which is a deferred version of the `name` variable. This means that the value of `deferredName` will always be one render behind the value of `name`.\n\nThe `useMemo` hook is used to create a memoized version of the `list` variable. The `list` variable is an array of 10,000 items, each of which is the `deferredName` variable. The `useMemo` hook ensures that the `list` variable is only recalculated when the `deferredName` variable changes.\n\nThe `handleChange` function is called whenever the input field value changes. It updates the `name` variable with the new value.\n\nFinally, the component returns a div that contains an input field and a list of items. The input field is bound to the `name` variable, and the `handleChange` function is called whenever the input field value changes.

It can also be used as a starting point for building more complex components that use these hooks. For example, the `useDeferredValue` hook can be used to optimize the rendering of large lists or tables, where the data changes frequently but the UI updates can be deferred. The `useMemo` hook can be used to optimize expensive calculations or data transformations that are used in the rendering of a component.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the useDeferredValue hook?\n   - The useDeferredValue hook is used to get a deferred value of a state, which means it returns the previous value of the state before it was updated.\n\n2. Why is the list generated using the useMemo hook?\n   - The useMemo hook is used to memoize the list generation process, which means it will only recompute the list when the dependencies (in this case, the deferredName state) change.\n\n3.

The `useMemo` hook takes two arguments: a function that returns the memoized value, and an array of dependencies that trigger the re-computation of the memoized value when they change. In this case, the `useMemo` hook is called with a function that returns the result of calling `computeExpensiveValue` with the current value of `number`, and an array that contains only `number` as a dependency.

When the \"reset\" button is clicked, the count is reset to 0 and the new count is displayed.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger React project to display and manage a count that can be incremented, decremented, or reset by the user. It can be customized by changing the initial state or the action types and corresponding state changes in the `reducer` function. For example, the count could be initialized to a different value or the buttons could be styled differently. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Counter from './Counter';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Counter App</h1>\n      <Counter />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `useReducer` hook in this code?\n- The `useReducer` hook is used to manage state in the `Counter` component by calling the `reducer` function with the current state and an action to update the state.\n\n2. What is the initial state of the `Counter` component?\n- The initial state of the `Counter` component is an object with a `count` property set to 0.\n\n3. What happens when an unknown action type is dispatched in the `reducer` function?\n- When an unknown action type is dispatched in the `reducer` function, an error is thrown.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/gist/useReducer.md"}}],["11",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ldarren/rhook-doc/gist/useRef.jsx)\n\nThis code is a React component that creates a custom input field with a red background color. The component is called `CustomInput` and is created using the `React.forwardRef` method, which allows the component to receive a `ref` prop that can be used to access the underlying DOM element. \n\nThe `CustomInput` component returns an `input` element with the `ref` prop set to the `ref` passed in from the parent component. It also spreads any other props passed in from the parent component, allowing for customization of the input field.\n\nThe `App` function is the main component that renders the `CustomInput` component and a button that, when clicked, focuses on the input field. The `App` component uses the `useState` hook to create a state variable called `value` that is initially set to an empty string. It also uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the `CustomInput` component.\n\nWhen the `CustomInput` component is rendered, it receives the `ref` created by the `useRef` hook and sets it as the `ref` prop of the `input` element. This allows the `App` component to access the `input` element and call its `focus` method when the button is clicked.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple example of how to create a custom input field in React and how to use the `useRef` hook to access the underlying DOM element. It can be used as a starting point for more complex input fields that require custom behavior or styling. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport CustomInput from './CustomInput';\n\nfunction MyForm() {\n  const inputRef = React.useRef();\n\n  const handleSubmit = (event) => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    console.log(inputRef.current.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <CustomInput ref={inputRef} />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default MyForm;\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `CustomInput` component and how is it different from a regular `input` element?\n   \n   The `CustomInput` component is a wrapper around the `input` element that sets a red background color and accepts a `ref` prop. It is different from a regular `input` element because it can be used with the `useRef` hook to access the underlying DOM node.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useState` and `useRef` hooks in the `App` component?\n   \n   The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the `value` variable, which represents the current value of the `CustomInput` component. The `useRef` hook is used to create a reference to the `CustomInput` component, which can be used to access its underlying DOM node.\n\n3. How does the `button` element interact with the `CustomInput` component?\n   \n   The `button` element has an `onClick` handler that calls the `focus` method on the `inputRef` object, which is a reference to the `CustomInput` component. This causes the `CustomInput` component to receive focus and become the active element in the document.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/gist/useRef.md"}}],["12",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ldarren/rhook-doc/gist/useState.jsx)\n\nThe code above is a React component that renders a simple counter with two buttons: one to increment the count and another to reset it. The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the count. \n\nThe `useState` hook is a built-in React hook that allows functional components to have state. It takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state and a function to update it. In this case, the initial value is 0 and the state is named `count`. The `setCount` function is used to update the state, and it takes a new value or a function that returns a new value based on the previous state. \n\nThe `handleIncrement` function is called when the \"Increment\" button is clicked. It uses the `setCount` function to update the count by adding 1 to the previous value. The `handleReset` function is called when the \"Reset\" button is clicked. It sets the count to 0 using the `setCount` function. \n\nThe component returns a JSX element that renders the current count and two buttons. The `onClick` prop of each button is set to the corresponding function. \n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display and manage a simple counter. It can be customized by changing the initial value of the count or adding more buttons with different functionality. Here's an example of how to use the `Example` component in another React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Example from './Example'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My Counter App</h1>\n      <Example />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `Example` component is imported and rendered inside the `App` component. The `App` component can have its own state and functionality, while the `Example` component handles the counter logic.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the useState hook in this code?\n- The useState hook is used to create a state variable called \"count\" and a function called \"setCount\" that can be used to update the value of \"count\".\n\n2. How does the handleIncrement function work?\n- The handleIncrement function uses the \"setCount\" function to update the value of \"count\" by adding 1 to its previous value.\n\n3. What is the output of this code when it is executed?\n- The output of this code is a React component that displays a count value and two buttons that can be used to increment the count or reset it to 0.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/gist/useState.md"}}],["13",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ldarren/rhook-doc/gist/useSyncExternalStore.jsx)\n\nThe code is a React component that uses the `useSyncExternalStore` hook to subscribe to the `scroll` event of the window object and return the current vertical scroll position of the window. The `useSyncExternalStore` hook is a custom hook that synchronizes the state of a React component with an external store, in this case, the window object. \n\nThe `subscribe` function is called when the component mounts and adds an event listener to the window object for the `scroll` event. It takes a callback function as an argument, which is called whenever the `scroll` event is triggered. The `subscribe` function returns a cleanup function that removes the event listener when the component unmounts.\n\nThe `useScrollY` function is a custom hook that takes an optional `selector` function as an argument. The `selector` function is used to transform the scroll position before it is returned. By default, the `selector` function returns the scroll position as is. The `useScrollY` function calls the `useSyncExternalStore` hook with the `subscribe` function, a function that returns the current scroll position using the `selector` function, and a function that always returns `true` to indicate that the component should always re-render when the external store changes.\n\nThe `ScrollY` component uses the `useScrollY` hook to get the current scroll position and renders it in a `div` element. When the component mounts, it subscribes to the `scroll` event of the window object and updates the scroll position whenever the event is triggered. When the component unmounts, it removes the event listener to prevent memory leaks.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project to track the scroll position of the window and trigger certain actions based on the scroll position. For example, it can be used to implement infinite scrolling, lazy loading of images, or sticky headers. The `selector` function can be used to transform the scroll position before it is used, for example, to round it to the nearest multiple of 100 or to convert it to a percentage of the total scrollable height.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `useSyncExternalStore` hook from the `react` library?\n- The `useSyncExternalStore` hook is used to synchronize a React component's state with an external data source.\n\n2.

The purpose of this component is to allow the user to search for items in a list by typing in a search query. The component uses React hooks to manage state and transitions.\n\nThe component starts by importing React, useState, and useTransition from the 'react' library. The useState hook is used to manage the state of the component. The name state variable is initialized to an empty string, and the all state variable is initialized to an array of 9999 items, each of which is a unique string generated from the current date and time. The list state variable is initialized to an empty array.\n\nThe useTransition hook is used to manage the transition state of the component. The isPending state variable is initialized to false, and the startTransition function is used to start a transition. The startTransition function takes a callback function that updates the list state variable based on the user's input.\n\nThe handleChange function is called whenever the user types in the input field. It updates the name state variable with the user's input and starts a transition. If the user's input is empty, the list state variable is set to an empty array. Otherwise, the list state variable is filtered to include only items that include the user's input.\n\nThe component returns a JSX expression that renders an input field and a list of items. If the component is in a transition state, a loading message is displayed. If the list state variable is not empty, a list of items is displayed. Otherwise, a message is displayed indicating that no items were found.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to allow the user to search for items in a list. The component can be customized by changing the initial state of the name and all variables, and by changing the JSX expression that renders the input field and list of items. For example, the component could be modified to display images or links instead of text items. Here is an example of how the component could be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport SearchList from './SearchList'\n\nfunction App() {\n  const items = [\n    {id: 1, name: 'apple'},\n    {id: 2, name: 'banana'},\n    {id: 3, name: 'cherry'},\n    {id: 4, name: 'date'},\n    {id: 5, name: 'elderberry'},\n  ]\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Search for Items</h1>\n      <SearchList items={items} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What does the `useTransition` hook do and why is it used in this code?\n   - The `useTransition` hook is used to delay rendering of the search results until the search is complete, which improves the user experience. A smart developer might want to know more about how this hook works and how it can be used in other contexts.\n2. What is the purpose of the `all` state variable and why is it initialized with an array of 9999 elements?\n   - The `all` state variable is used to store a large array of strings that will be searched when the user types in the search box. It is initialized with 9999 elements to ensure that it is large enough to handle a large number of search queries without being re-initialized.\n3. How does the `handleChange` function work and what is its role in the search functionality?\n   - The `handleChange` function is called whenever the user types in the search box and updates the `name` state variable with the current value of the search box. It then uses the `startTransition` function to delay rendering of the search results until the search is complete. Finally, it filters the `all` array to find all items that include the search term and updates the `list` state variable with the results. A smart developer might want to know more about how the filtering works and how it could be optimized for large datasets.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/gist/useTransition.md"}}],["15",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/ldarren/rhook-doc/index.html)\n\nThis code is an HTML file that serves as the entry point for the Captain Hook web application. The purpose of this file is to provide the basic structure and dependencies required to run the application in a web browser. \n\nThe HTML file includes a meta tag for character encoding and viewport settings, as well as a title element for the web page. The body of the HTML file contains a single div element with an id of \"root\". This div element will be used by the React application to render its components.\n\nThe file also includes two script tags. The first script tag imports the Babel standalone library from the unpkg content delivery network. Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write modern JavaScript code and have it transpiled to a version of JavaScript that is compatible with older browsers. The second script tag imports the main.jsx file, which is the entry point for the React application.\n\nThe main.jsx file is a JavaScript file that contains the code for the Captain Hook web application. This file is transpiled by Babel and executed in the web browser.

Then, it imports two custom components: Router and App. \n\nThe `ReactDOM.createRoot()` method is called to create a root element for the React application. This method takes in an HTML element as an argument, in this case, the element with the ID of 'root'. \n\nThe `root.render()` method is then called to render the main application component.

This file contains code that compiles and runs user-provided code snippets in a sandboxed environment. The code is transpiled using Babel and parsed using Acorn. The `compile` function takes in a code snippet and a `render` callback function. It then transforms the code, gets the AST, finds the `React.createElement` expression in the body of the program, converts it to source, and transforms it to `render(React.createElement(...))`. The `render` function is passed as a parameter to the wrapper function returned by `compile`. The `run` function compiles and invokes the wrapper function with the `render` and `require` functions as parameters. The `require` function is used to resolve dependencies, and the `toString` function just compiles and returns the stringified wrapper function. The `create` function returns an object with the `compile`, `run`, `toString`, and `unmount` functions. The `unmount` function is used to unmount the root element and prevent errors when React is already rendering.\n\nHere is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:\n\n```jsx\nimport { create } from 'rhook-doc'\n\nconst el = document.getElementById('root')\nconst moduleResolver = (moduleName) => {\n  if (moduleName === 'lodash') {\n    return require('lodash')\n  }\n}\n\nconst sandbox = create(el, moduleResolver)\n\nconst code = `\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n`\n\nsandbox.run(code)\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a sandbox using the `create` function and pass in the root element and a module resolver function. We then use the `run` function to compile and run a code snippet that uses the `useState` hook. The `render` function is automatically passed to the wrapper function returned by `compile`. If there are any errors during compilation or runtime, they will be rendered in the root element.
