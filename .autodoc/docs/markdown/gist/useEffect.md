The code above is a React component that uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to create a simple counter that increments every second. The component is named `Example` and is exported for use in other parts of the project.

The `useState` hook is used to create a state variable called `count` and a function called `setCount` that can be used to update the value of `count`. The initial value of `count` is set to 0.

The `useEffect` hook is used to run a function that updates the value of `count` every second using the `setCount` function. The `useEffect` hook takes two arguments: a function to run and an array of dependencies. In this case, the array is empty, which means the effect will only run once when the component mounts.

The `setInterval` function is used to run the function that updates the value of `count` every second. The `clearInterval` function is returned from the `useEffect` hook to clean up the interval when the component unmounts.

The `Example` component returns a `div` element that contains a `p` element that displays the value of `count`. The component is then rendered using the `<Example/>` syntax.

This component can be used in other parts of the project to display a simple counter that updates every second. For example, it could be used in a dashboard to display the number of users currently online or the number of messages sent in the last hour. The `useState` and `useEffect` hooks can also be used in other components to manage state and side effects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useState` hook in this code?
- The `useState` hook is used to declare a state variable called `count` and a function called `setCount` that can be used to update the value of `count`.

2. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?
- The `useEffect` hook is used to set up an interval that increments the `count` state variable every second, and to clean up the interval when the component unmounts.

3. What does the `return () => clearInterval(interval)` statement do?
- This statement returns a function that clears the interval set up by the `setInterval` function when the component unmounts.
