This code defines a React functional component called `NameFields` that renders two input fields for a user's first and last name. The component uses the `useId` hook from the `react` library to generate unique IDs for the input fields and their corresponding labels. 

The `useId` hook generates a unique ID that can be used as the `id` attribute for an HTML element. This is useful for ensuring that the `id` attribute is unique across the entire page, which is important for accessibility and for associating labels with their corresponding form elements. 

In the `NameFields` component, the `useId` hook is called to generate a unique ID, which is then concatenated with the strings "-firstName" and "-lastName" to create unique IDs for the first name and last name input fields and their corresponding labels. The `htmlFor` attribute of the `label` elements is set to the corresponding ID of the input field, which ensures that clicking on the label focuses the corresponding input field. 

This component can be used in a larger form or user input component to render fields for a user's name. For example, it could be used in a registration form or a user profile form. 

Here is an example of how the `NameFields` component could be used in a larger form component:

```
import React from 'react';
import NameFields from './NameFields';

function RegistrationForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <NameFields />
      <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
      <div>
        <input id="email" type="email" />
      </div>
      <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
      <div>
        <input id="password" type="password" />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Register</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useId` hook being imported from React?
- The `useId` hook is being used to generate unique IDs for the input fields.

2. Why are `htmlFor` attributes being used in the `label` elements?
- The `htmlFor` attributes are being used to associate the `label` elements with their corresponding `input` elements using the `id` attribute. This improves accessibility by allowing screen readers to read the label when the input is focused.

3. What is the expected output of rendering the `NameFields` component?
- The `NameFields` component will render two input fields for the user to enter their first and last name, respectively, with associated labels. The `id` attribute of each input field will be unique due to the use of the `useId` hook.
